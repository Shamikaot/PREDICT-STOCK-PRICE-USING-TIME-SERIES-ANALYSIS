# PREDICT-STOCK-PRICE-USING-TIME-SERIES-ANALYSIS
Created a time series forecasting model for a bajaj finance dataset to predict what can be the VWAP ( Volume weighted average price) using auto AREMA
( Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average ) model. Auto AREMA is nothing but an automated machine learning model mainly used to forecasting
the dataset.
